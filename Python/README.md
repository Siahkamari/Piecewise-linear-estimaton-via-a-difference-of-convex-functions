# Piecewise Linear Regression via a Difference of Convex Functions

## Prerequisites:
1. python 3.7

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)

5. [cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (only for GPU version)

6. [torch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.7.0+cu110 (only for GPU version)


## How to run?

There is a class provided in "piecewise_linear_estimation.py" which does piece-wise linear regression. See the "example_airfoil_data.ipynb" for an example on how to use it. If you have a CUDA enabled GPU the training time would be siginificantly faster.
