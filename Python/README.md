# Piecewise Linear Regression via a Difference of Convex Functions

## Prerequisites:
1. python 3.9

## How to run?

There is a class provided in "piecewise_linear_estimation.py" which does piece-wise linear regression. See the "example.ipynb" to learn on how to use it. If you have a CUDA enabled GPU the training time would be siginificantly faster.
